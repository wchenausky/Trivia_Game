# Trivia_Game

This is a fun game I made to test your knowledge of JavaScript. It's 5 questions to see how well you know some basic JavaScript. This has been easily one of the more difficult projects I've worked on so far. With a lot of help from the internet and peers I was able to get it done. I hope you enjoy!
